6. Financial Statements

6.1 Did Net profit rise or fall due to changes in:

a. Sales?
b. Gross margin?
c. Operating margin?
d. Interest expense, taxes?
e. Non-recurring items?
How to Find: Look at the income statement (also known as the statement of profit and loss) in the annual report.
a. Sales: Check for revenue or sales figures over multiple years to see if they are rising or falling.
b. Gross Margin: Calculate the gross margin by comparing gross profit to revenue over multiple years.
c. Operating Margin: Calculate the operating margin by comparing operating profit to revenue over multiple years.
d. Interest Expense and Taxes: Check the income statement for interest expenses and taxes paid.
e. Non-recurring Items: Look for any notes or disclosures in the financial statements that highlight non-recurring or exceptional items.
6.2 Is the cash cycle rising or falling? Why?

How to Find: Examine the cash flow statement and the balance sheet in the annual report.
The cash cycle can be calculated using data from the balance sheet (inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover) and the cash flow statement (operating cash flows).
Look for trends in these ratios over multiple years to determine if the cash cycle is increasing or decreasing.
6.3 Is operating cash flow sound?

a. Is inventory rising much faster than COGS?
b. Are receivables rising faster than sales?
How to Find: Refer to the cash flow statement in the annual report.
a. Calculate the ratio of inventory turnover (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) and compare it to previous years. If inventory turnover is declining significantly, it may indicate a problem.
b. Calculate the accounts receivable turnover ratio (Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable) and compare it to previous years. A declining ratio may suggest issues with collecting receivables.
6.4 Is Gearing too high? (e.g., Net Gearing > 50%)

How to Find: Review the balance sheet and notes to the financial statements.
Calculate the gearing ratio, which compares the company's debt to its equity (Total Debt / Total Equity). If the result is greater than 50%, it may indicate high gearing.
6.5 Is Debt repayable within 1 year very close to Net OCF for the firm?

How to Find: Refer to the cash flow statement and balance sheet.
Compare the company's short-term debt (current liabilities) to its net operating cash flow. If short-term debt is close to or exceeds net operating cash flow, it could be a concern.
6.6 Is ROE improving or declining?

How to Find: Calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) using data from the income statement and balance sheet.
ROE = Net Profit / Shareholder's Equity
Compare ROE over multiple years to determine if it's improving or declining.
6.7 Review changes to accounting policy (e.g., depreciation and R&D capitalization).

How to Find: Look for any notes to the financial statements or accounting policy disclosures in the annual report.
Changes in accounting policies are typically explained in the notes. Pay attention to changes that may impact the recognition of revenue or expenses.
By following these steps, you can analyze financial ratios and gain insights into the company's financial performance and stability.
